The Aiguille du Midi is the highest mountain peak served by an aerial lift system. The name translates literally to 'Needle of the Mid-day'. The mountain lies to the south-east of Chamonix and when viewed from in front of the church it indicates that it is noon when the sun passes over its summit.",
